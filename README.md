# Node Names

This is a 2-person game based on the board game Code Names Duet. It's meant to be played on a tablet sitting on a surface between the two players, with each player using their phone to view their unique secret pattern.

## How to Play

## Set Up

There are two players: Yellow Player & Pink Player. The yellow player always goes first, and faces the side of the board showing the yellow half of the cards. The pink player sits on the opposite side of the board and goes second. Each player has six cards that they need the other player to guess. Some of these cards may be overlapping.

### Getting Your Pattern

To start the game, click "Get My Pattern" and scan the QR codes with your phone to view the secret pattern of cards you need the other player to guess. You can shuffle this pattern to come up with a new one if you want, but once you've picked one don't change it until the game is over.

The yellow player should have the yellow pattern on their phone, and the pink player should have the pink pattern on theirs. Don't show the other player your pattern!

### Starting the Game

Once you have your patterns, return to the main page. You can click "reset board" as many times as you'd like to reshuffle the cards. Once you're happy with the words on the board, click "start game." The yellow player always goes first.

### Game Round

Each round is simple. The current player gives a 1-word hint and a number of cards that they want their teammate to guess based on that clue. For example, if you wanted to the player to guess "monkey" and "alligator" you could say "animal for two." When the other player makes a guess, tap the card and choose if it was correct or not. If it's correct, it turns black. If not, click no and end the turn.

To end your turn, click "end my turn." The row of dots in front of each player marks their total number of turns (five). They turn black after each turn to mark completion.

### Marking Progress on Your Pattern

To keep track of which cards have been correctly guessed, you can tap the card corresponding to the correct guess on your phone. It will turn black to mark itself as guessed. (If you accidentally tap the wrong card, tap again to undo.)

### Game End

The game is over when all of five of each players' turns are complete (when all dots are black). If you guessed all of the cards in each player's pattern, you won! If not... try again!
